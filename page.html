The atmosphere was free of human-induced pollution, with natural cycles maintaining ecological balance. Volcanic activity was the primary source of atmospheric changes, but these were natural processes without long-term degradation.",

Early humans began to appear, using fire and basic tools, but their impact on the environment was negligible.

Small-scale pollution emerged from metal smelting and waste disposal, but the global environment remained largely intact. Rivers and air quality started to show localized degradation near settlements.",

World Wars drove industrial production to new heights, with chemical warfare and mass manufacturing leaving environmental scars. Oil spills and early signs of global warming began to emerge as concerns.",

Air pollution worsened with smog in cities like Los Angeles, while water pollution from pesticides, fertilizers, and industrial runoff devastated aquatic ecosystems. Deforestation and habitat loss accelerated, and nuclear testing added radioactive pollution.",

Air quality in urban areas deteriorated due to vehicle emissions and industrial activity, while microplastics polluted oceans and entered food chains. Efforts to combat pollution intensified, with renewable energy and recycling initiatives, but the cumulative damage remained severe.",
